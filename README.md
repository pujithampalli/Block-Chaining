# Block-Chaining

Implemented various modes of block chaining. The following are assumptions/specifications/requirements for the project:<br/>
• Implementing CBC, PCBC, and CFB<br/>
• Assumed the blocks are 64 bits in size.<br/>
• Assumed the IV (Initialization Vector) is the same size as the plaintext block.<br/>
• Assumed that the plaintext will be ascii.<br/>
• You will be required to pad messages that are not in multiples of 64 bits (8 bytes).<br/>
